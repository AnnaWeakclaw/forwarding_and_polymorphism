## Forwarding and Polymorphism
This is a better way of organising your code in Object Oriented Programming.
Forwarding - do a check first and then call your new user class.

### If we're adding code we're not changing existing code â€” so we can't be adding any new bugs to our existing classes.
Polymorphism - all the classes with compare method doing different comparisons.
